# Dev Env

There are a few base tools that this project relies on the developer to have installed:

1. nvm: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating.
2. Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/.
3. Task: https://taskfile.dev/installation/.

To initialize and deploy the project, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured with access.
